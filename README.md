The website is a group project aimed at replicating the popular video-sharing platform, YouTube. The main purpose of the project was to create a functioning website with similar features and functionality to YouTube.

One of the key features of the website is the ability to share videos through a shareable link. Users can copy and send the link to others, allowing them to directly access and view the shared video. This feature enables easy sharing and distribution of content across the platform.

The website also includes a search bar that allows users to find videos based on their preferences. When users enter a search query, the website's search functionality retrieves relevant videos from the database and displays them to the user. This feature enhances user experience by providing a quick and efficient way to discover specific videos.

Additionally, the website incorporates a comment section where users can leave comments on videos. This feature enables user interaction and engagement, allowing users to express their thoughts, opinions, and feedback on the videos they watch. It promotes community building and fosters a sense of participation among users.

Overall, our YouTube clone project successfully replicates some of the core features of the original platform, such as video sharing, search functionality, and user comments. It showcases our collaborative effort with two other developers and demonstrates our ability to create a functional and interactive website resembling YouTube.

<!-- ## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
